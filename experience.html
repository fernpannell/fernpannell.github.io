				<h2 class="exp_header">Sky: Software Engineer Intern</h2>
				<p>I completed a summer internship for the Sky Software Engineering Academy under
					the newly founded Sky Labs department. Worked with a technology team on a full-stack development web application
					linking all employees at Sky to their involvement in the Sky Labs innovation sessions. The developed application used the following:</p>
				<ul id="sky_list">
					<li>Back-end: Java</li>
					<li>Front-end: JavaScript (ReactJS)</li>
					<li>Neo4j Graph Database and Cypher query language</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="exp_header">CERN: Science Gateway Exhibit Development</h2>
				<p>Team "Hefty Protons" was formed for the CERN 2020 Science Communication Hackathon.
				We developed an exhibt over the course of 3 months on the mass of the proton, which
				was subsequently pitched at the closing ceremony. Our exhibit went on to win the
				Audience Choice award, and is now moving onto the next stage of development with the
				the CERN exhibitions team.</p>
				<h2 class="exp_header">UCL HEP: Website Re-development</h2>
				<p>Revamping the UCL High Energy Physics website! This site is long overdue some major
					stylistic changes, as well as tweaks made to reduce duplicated functionality. Having
					interned as a software engineer, I was offered the opportunity to undertake this project!
					I recruited another undergraduate looking for web development experience to assist on this,
					and we expect to have the finished website published by the middle of 2021.</p>
